This repo is a project for developing skills at the Data Analytics bootcamp of Ironhack Madrid by querying a MongoDB database and doing some geospacial analysis with maps in jupyter notebook.

**Actually under construction**. My current To-Do-List:

- [x] First queries in mongodb
- [x] Pandas explode for coords
- [x] Carto maps
- [x] Google places API
- [ ] Conclusions
- [ ] Move aux functions to aux.py
- [ ] Work with the storytelling in Jupyter
- [ ] Compose a PDF with the results?
- [ ] Readme
